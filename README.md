## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option A — Docker Compose (recommended)

Docker Compose starts Mailserver together with a PostgreSQL database automatically:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env to set your HOSTNAME and other settings
docker compose up -d
```

Then open **http://your-server:8080** in your browser.

### Option B — Docker Run (bring your own PostgreSQL)

If you already have a PostgreSQL instance, you can run the container directly:

```bash
docker run -d --name mailserver \
  -p 25:25 -p 587:587 -p 465:465 -p 2525:2525 \
  -p 143:143 -p 993:993 -p 110:110 -p 995:995 \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v maildata:/data \
  -e HOSTNAME=mail.example.com \
  -e DATABASE_URL=postgres://mailserver:mailserver@your-pg-host/mailserver \
  ghcr.io/tayyebi/mailserver:main
```

## 🔑 First Login

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Username** | `admin` |
| **Password** | `admin` |

> ⚠️ **Change your password immediately** after first login via **Settings**.

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Enable TOTP-based 2FA from the Settings page. Once enabled, append your 6-digit code to your password at login.

**Example:** password `secret` + TOTP `123456` → enter `secret123456`

## 🌐 Admin Dashboard Walkthrough

### Domains

Add your mail domains, generate DKIM signing keys with one click, and get a ready-to-use DNS runbook showing every record you need (MX, SPF, DKIM, DMARC, PTR).

![Domains](docs/screenshots/domains.jpg)

### Accounts

Create email accounts for your users. Set display names, passwords, and per-account storage quotas.

![Accounts](docs/screenshots/accounts.jpg)

### Aliases & Catch-all

Create forwarding rules between addresses. Use `*@yourdomain.com` as a catch-all to capture mail sent to any address on the domain. Toggle open tracking per alias.

### Forwarding

Set up rules to forward mail from a local address to any external email address. Optionally keep a local copy in the original mailbox. Useful for redirecting mail to third-party inboxes without changing the sender's experience.

### Open Tracking

When tracking is enabled on an alias, outgoing emails get a tiny invisible tracking pixel injected into the HTML body. Every time the recipient opens the email, a record is created. View detailed per-message open reports from the **Tracking** section.

![Tracking](docs/screenshots/tracking.jpg)

### Webmail

A lightweight webmail client is built right into the admin panel. Browse folders, read messages, compose new emails (with CC, BCC, Reply-To, priority, and custom headers), and delete messages — all without leaving the browser.

![Webmail](docs/screenshots/webmail.jpg)

### Fail2ban

Mailserver includes a built-in fail2ban system that monitors Postfix and Dovecot logs for repeated authentication failures on SMTP, IMAP, and POP3. Offending IPs are automatically banned. You can:

- Configure thresholds and ban duration per service
- Manually ban or unban individual IPs or CIDR ranges
- Maintain a permanent whitelist and blacklist
- Review a full audit log of all ban/unban events

![Fail2ban](docs/screenshots/fail2ban.jpg)

### Queue

Inspect the live Postfix mail queue and flush stuck messages directly from the admin panel — no SSH required.

### DMARC Reports

Designate one or more mailboxes as DMARC report inboxes. The dashboard automatically parses incoming DMARC aggregate reports and lets you visualize pass/fail results, sending sources, and policy dispositions per domain.

### DNS Check

Per-domain DNS health checker with individual shortcut links for each record type. Catch delivery problems before they affect your users.

### Config Viewer

Inspect the live Postfix, Dovecot, and OpenDKIM configuration files generated from your database — useful for debugging.

### Outbound Relays

Configure external SMTP relays to route outbound mail through third-party providers (e.g. SendGrid, SES, or a corporate relay). Relays can be assigned globally or scoped to a specific domain, account, or alias, with support for PLAIN and LOGIN authentication.

### WebDAV File Storage

Each mail account gets a personal WebDAV drive at `/dav/{email}/`. Users can mount it in their OS file manager, upload/download files, and share individual files via one-time FileLink download URLs — all authenticated with their mail credentials.

### CalDAV Calendar Server

A built-in CalDAV server at `/caldav/{email}/` lets users sync calendars using any CalDAV-compatible client (Thunderbird, Apple Calendar, DAVx⁵ on Android, etc.). Calendars are created from the admin panel and are scoped per mail account.

### MCP API (AI Assistant Integration)

A [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) endpoint at `POST /mcp` exposes mail operations to AI assistants and automation tools. Supported tools: `list_accounts`, `list_emails`, `read_email`, `send_email`, `delete_email`. Authentication uses the same admin credentials.

## 🔌 Port Reference

| Port | Protocol | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| `25` | SMTP | Inbound mail from the Internet |
| `587` | SMTP Submission | Outbound mail (authenticated) |
| `465` | SMTPS | Outbound mail over TLS (authenticated) |
| `2525` | SMTP Alt | Alternative submission port |
| `143` | IMAP | Email retrieval (STARTTLS) |
| `993` | IMAPS | Email retrieval over TLS |
| `110` | POP3 | Email retrieval (STARTTLS) |
| `995` | POP3S | Email retrieval over TLS |
| `8080` | HTTP | Admin dashboard & webmail |

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

All settings are managed from the admin dashboard. The only file you need to edit before starting is `.env`:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `HOSTNAME` | `mail.example.com` | Fully-qualified domain name of the mail server |
| `HTTP_PORT` | `8080` | Admin dashboard port |
| `SMTP_PORT` | `25` | Inbound SMTP port |
| `SUBMISSION_PORT` | `587` | Submission port |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `postgres://mailserver:mailserver@localhost/mailserver` | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `SEED_USER` | `admin` | Initial admin username |
| `SEED_PASS` | `admin` | Initial admin password |
| `TZ` | `UTC` | Container timezone |

---

## 💾 Persistent Data

All mail data is stored in the `maildata` Docker volume mounted at `/data`:

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `/data/ssl/` | TLS certificates (auto-generated self-signed on first start) |
| `/data/dkim/` | DKIM signing keys |
| `/data/mail/` | User mailboxes (Maildir format) |

The PostgreSQL database (accounts, domains, aliases, tracking data) is required by the mail server. When using Docker Compose, it runs in a separate `db` container with its data stored in the `maildb` volume. When running standalone, point `DATABASE_URL` to your own PostgreSQL instance.

---

## 🌍 DNS Setup

After adding a domain in the admin panel, go to **Domains → DNS** to get the exact DNS records you need to publish:

- **MX** — points incoming mail to your server
- **SPF** — authorizes your server to send mail for the domain
- **DKIM** — cryptographic signature for outbound mail (key generated in the dashboard)
- **DMARC** — policy for handling SPF/DKIM failures
- **PTR** — reverse DNS (set at your VPS provider)

The dashboard shows copy-pasteable values for every record.
