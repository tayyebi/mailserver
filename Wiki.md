## A Step-by-Step Guide to SPF, DKIM, and DMARC

### Understanding the Basics

Before diving into the technicalities, it's essential to understand what each of these protocols does:

* **SPF (Sender Policy Framework):** Authorizes IP addresses allowed to send emails on behalf of your domain.
* **DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail):** Digitally signs your emails to verify their authenticity.
* **DMARC (Domain-Based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance):** Provides instructions on how to handle emails that fail SPF or DKIM checks.

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Set Up SPF

* **Identify sending IP addresses:** Determine all IP addresses used to send emails for your domain. This might include your email server, email marketing platforms, or other services.
* **Create the SPF record:** Use an SPF record generator or manually create a TXT record with the following format:
  ```
  v=spf1 include:spf.example.com -all
  ```
  Replace `spf.example.com` with the domain of your email service provider. The `-all` part specifies that any email sent from an IP address not listed in the record should be rejected.
* **Add the SPF record to your DNS:** Log in to your domain registrar and add a TXT record with the hostname `@` and the value of your SPF record.

#### 2. Set Up DKIM

* **Generate a DKIM key pair:** Use a DKIM key generator to create a public and private key.
* **Create a DKIM selector:** Choose a unique name for your DKIM selector (e.g., `mail`).
* **Create a DKIM record:** Combine the selector, domain, and public key to create a TXT record. For example:
  ```
  mail._domainkey.example.com
  ```
* **Add the DKIM record to your DNS:** Add the generated TXT record to your DNS.
* **Configure your email server:** Implement DKIM signing on your email server using the private key.

#### 3. Set Up DMARC

* **Choose a policy:** Decide on a DMARC policy: `p=none` (monitor only), `p=quarantine` (quarantine suspicious emails), or `p=reject` (reject suspicious emails).
* **Create a DMARC record:** Create a TXT record with the following format:
  ```
  v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc_reports@yourdomain.com
  ```
  Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain and adjust the policy (`p=`) as needed.
* **Add the DMARC record to your DNS:** Add the generated TXT record to your DNS.

#### 4. Monitor and Adjust

* **Check alignment:** Ensure your SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records are aligned correctly.
* **Monitor DMARC reports:** Analyze DMARC reports to identify issues and improve your email authentication.
* **Adjust your records:** Make necessary changes to your SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records based on the reports.
* **Consider a DMARC analyzer:** Use a tool to simplify the process and provide insights.

### Additional Tips
* **Start with `p=none` for DMARC:** This allows you to monitor email authentication without impacting email delivery.
* **Use a DMARC analyzer:** Tools like DMARCly or MXToolbox can help you manage and analyze DMARC reports.
* **Test thoroughly:** Send test emails to different email providers to verify correct setup.
* **Keep records up-to-date:** Regularly review and update your SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records.

By following these steps and carefully monitoring your email authentication, you can significantly improve your email deliverability and protect your domain from spoofing.

## Postfix SMTP/LMTP client policy - SASL mechanism properties

Just like the Postfix SMTP server, the SMTP client has a policy that determines which SASL mechanisms are acceptable, based on their properties. The next two sections give examples of how these policies are used.

    Property 	Description
    noanonymous 	Don't use mechanisms that permit anonymous authentication.
    noplaintext 	Don't use mechanisms that transmit unencrypted username and password information.
    nodictionary 	Don't use mechanisms that are vulnerable to dictionary attacks.
    mutual_auth 	Use only mechanisms that authenticate both the client and the server to each other.
